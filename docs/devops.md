# DevOps & CI Setup

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration.

## CI Pipeline
- Backend tests run automatically on every push
- Frontend build is validated using Vite
- CI failures must be fixed before merging

## Developer Guidelines
- Always check the Actions tab after pushing code
- Do not merge if CI fails
